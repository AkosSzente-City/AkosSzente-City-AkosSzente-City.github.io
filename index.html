      <h3>Akos Szente</h3>
      <p> This bootcamp is my first expreience with coding. I did not have prior knowledge about programming.
	  After 2 weeks, I am able to understand certain parts of the code and I have learned many concepts
	  that were new to me. Furthermore, I have faced many problems and challenges throughout the bootcamp, 
	  but I believe that the confusing parts will become clear once I get more practice.
	  Hobbies:
	  In my free time I enjoy listening to music, playing games
	  reading and playing the guitar.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Geometrical animation</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of if statements, loops, and randomness. I have created this
	geometrical animation that has a calming affect. it used a bit of user interaction
	in the form of responding to certain key presses and mouse movements. 
	The keys of r g b are used to represent the RGB pallete. Whichever key is pressed, 
	the animation will display a shade of the given colour. For example, if r is pressed the
	animation would be a shade of red. If the spacebar is pressed, a random colour would be displayed.
	Furthermore, if the mouse is moved from left to right, the speed increases. if it is moved from bottom
	to the top, the number of lines that are displayed increases. The backbone of the project are 
	the mathematical functtions that allow the formation of the curved paths that the lines follow.
	The moving lines also have opacity added. From the range of 1 to 40, the lines that are closer to
	1 are the most transparent, while the lines that are closer to 40 are solid or barely transparent.
